# FilterDialog
A UX test to try out various filter dialog designs to allow for input of (limited) boolean expressions

## Why

Allowing a user to enter boolean expressions is no small task. Allowing the user to do so easily is even harder.
Tailviewer needs an overhaul of its filter design (since it currently only allows chaining filters by AND) but deciding on the correct design
is very hard. This playground exists to try out different designs and to see how they play out.
